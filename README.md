# IR_SCOOTER_V001
Firstly , as a microcontroller STM32F103C8 is chosen. Inside of the controller , we are planing to use SPI ,I2C , CAN, USB and UART protocols. 
Secondly , in addition to protocols we have hall sensors , current and temperature masurement , PWM signals and BEMF input pins.  
Last and the purpose of the system is that , driving 36V 600W trapezoidal BEMF PMSM(BLDC). 
As it is seen above , we want to drive a PMSM for a scooter project.
In extra , STM32CUBEIDE files are included.
